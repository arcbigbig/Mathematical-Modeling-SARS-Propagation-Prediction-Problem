# Mathematical-Modeling-SARS-Propagation-Prediction-Problem
A mathematical modeling problem, titled SARS transmission prediction, belongs to the "Big data" question type with small amount of data, and is the subject of mathematical modeling training for graduate students in our school in summer. (There are similarities between this question and the F question on mathematical modeling for graduate students in the 2022 Huawei Cup, predicting the Changchun epidemic.). These codes also refer to many articles by CSDN influencers. Here, all the codes compiled last year are uploaded to the warehouse for students to refer to and learn from. 

一个数学建模问题，题目为SARS传播预测，属于小数据量的“大数据”的题型，是我们学校暑期研究生数学建模培训的题目。（这道题和2022年华为杯研究生数学建模的F题长春疫情预测有相似的地方）。这些代码也参考了很多CSDN上大佬的文章，这里将去年整理的代码全部上传到仓库里，供同学们参考学习。
